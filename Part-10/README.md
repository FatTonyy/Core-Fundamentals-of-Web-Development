## 10. Adding Edit and Delete Functionality

![screen](screen.png)

[Go to the video]()



In this video, we will add the ability to edit and delete links.  We will save code by reusing the same add link form and event listener, both when a user is adding a new link and editing an old link.  This video will serve as a reinforcement of previous videos in working with DOM elements, event listeners, arrow functions, etc.
