## 3. Introduction to Flexbox and Building the Navbar

[Go to the video]()



In this video, we will get introduced to Flexbox, which provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container.  With Flexbox, we can address problems easily that, in the past, were hard to solve such as vertically centering content inside of a parent, providing equal space to children of a container, and ensuring a consistent height across multiple columns of varied content.  We will specifically leverage Flexbox to build a simple navigation navigation bar that contains a title and an add button.
