In this video, we will stub out the basic structure of our application.  We will create placeholders in our HTML for our Navbar, our Add Link Form, and our Links List display.  We will also perform some setup in CSS by creating CSS Variables for our application colors, defining basic resets to standardize rendering across browsers, and organizing our CSS file into sections.
