## 13. Full Screen Popups

[Go to the video]()



In this video, we will create a full screen popup for our add link form.  This way it does not push down our links list content when the user wants to add a link.  This full screen popup can be used in many ways (logins/register forms, loading icons, etc.).  It will take up the entire width and height of the window with a semi transparent dark background.  This lets the user know that they are unable to interact with anything in the background until loading has finished, they complete a form, etc.
