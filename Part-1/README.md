[Go to the video]()



In this video, we will talk about the tools we will be using in this course.  I want to make sure that everyone is on the same page as we progress throughout the course.  We will talk about various shortcuts and extensions in Visual Studio Code as well as a brief introduction to the Chrome Developer Tools to inspect elements and their styles as well as the console to inspect output from out Javascript.  It is highly recommended that you attempt to follow along and use the shortcuts that are available as they will help speed up your development process in the future!
